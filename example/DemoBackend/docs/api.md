# Authentication

## Overview

Authentication is a critical component of any REST API backend, ensuring that only authorized users can access the resources provided by the API. In the context of the DemoBackend project, which uses AWS Cognito for authentication, this section will provide detailed information on how authentication works within the system.

## Authentication Mechanism

The DemoBackend utilizes Amazon Cognito as its primary authentication service. Cognito provides a robust set of features for managing user identities and access control, making it suitable for backend applications like the DemoBackend.

### Key Features of Amazon Cognito

1. **User Pool**: A pool of users that can be managed through AWS Management Console or programmatically.
2. **Identity Providers**: Integrate with third-party identity providers such as Google, Facebook, or email/password.
3. **Access Control Policies**: Define rules to control access to resources based on user attributes and roles.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhance security by requiring additional verification steps.

### Integration with the DemoBackend

The integration between Amazon Cognito and the DemoBackend involves several key components:

- **API Gateway**: Acts as a proxy for incoming requests, handling authentication before passing them to the backend services.
- **Lambda Functions**: Backend functions that handle specific API endpoints. These functions are triggered by API Gateway events.

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration/Authentication**:
   - Users can register using their preferred identity provider or create an account with a username and password.
   - Cognito handles the registration process, including email verification if required.

2. **Token Generation**:
   - After successful authentication, Cognito generates access tokens (JWTs) that are used to authenticate subsequent requests.
   - These tokens contain user information and permissions.

3. **Authorization**:
   - API Gateway uses these tokens to authorize incoming requests by checking the associated policies.
   - Backend functions can also use these tokens for additional authorization checks.

### Example Authentication Request

Here is an example of a request that includes authentication using AWS Cognito:

GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
Host: demo-backend.com
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

In this example, the `Authorization` header contains a JWT token issued by Amazon Cognito.

## Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Secure Token Storage**: Ensure that access tokens are stored securely on the client side (e.g., using HTTPS) and not exposed in logs or error messages.
2. **Token Expiry**: Implement short-lived tokens to reduce the risk of unauthorized access if a token is compromised.
3. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of authentication policies and user permissions to ensure compliance with security standards.
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Enable logging for authentication events to detect any suspicious activity.

## Cross-Reference

- [Lambda Functions](lambda-functions.md)

## Conclusion

Authentication is a fundamental aspect of any REST API backend. By leveraging Amazon Cognito, the DemoBackend provides a secure and scalable solution for managing user identities and access control. Following best practices and considering security considerations will help ensure that the authentication mechanism remains robust and effective over time.

# API Documentation: Error Handling

## Overview

Error handling is a critical aspect of any software system, especially in REST APIs. It ensures that the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide meaningful feedback to users or other systems. This document outlines the error handling strategy implemented in the `DemoBackend` project.

## Core Requirements

The `DemoBackend` project adheres to several core requirements, which include:

- **File Storage**: The system supports file uploads and downloads.
- **User Authentication**: Users can authenticate using Amazon Cognito.
- **Search Functionality**: Provides search capabilities for various data sources.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all API requests.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Codes

The project uses a standardized error code system to categorize errors. Each error is associated with a specific HTTP status code and a descriptive message. This allows clients to easily understand the nature of the error.

#### Example Error Code Structure

{
  "error_code": "401",
  "message": "Unauthorized: Access token expired or invalid."
}

### Error Handling Flow

The error handling flow is designed to be robust and user-friendly. It involves:

1. **Client Request**: The client sends a request to the API.
2. **API Gateway**: The API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to the appropriate service.
3. **Service Layer**: The service layer processes the request and may encounter errors.
4. **Error Handling Logic**: The error handling logic in the service layer determines the appropriate response.
5. **Response Generation**: The response is generated with an appropriate HTTP status code, error message, and optional details.

### Error Response Format

The API returns a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "error_code": "404",
  "message": "Resource not found.",
  "details": {
    "resource_type": "user",
    "resource_id": "12345"
  }
}

### Error Handling Considerations

- **Logging**: Detailed logs are generated for all errors, including error codes, timestamps, and client information.
- **Monitoring**: Monitoring tools are used to track error rates and identify patterns.
- **Feedback Loop**: Feedback from users is collected to improve the error handling strategy.

## Cross-References

- [API Overview](api-overview.md)
- [Authentication](authentication.md)
- [Search Functionality](search-functionality.md)

## Best Practices

1. **Use Standard Error Codes**: Consistent error codes help in maintaining a clear understanding of errors across different parts of the system.
2. **Provide Meaningful Messages**: Clear and descriptive messages help users understand what went wrong.
3. **Logging**: Logging should be comprehensive to aid in debugging and monitoring.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Regular feedback from users can inform improvements in error handling.

## Examples

### Example 1: Unauthorized Access

**Request:**
GET /api/data
Authorization: Bearer expired_token

**Response:**
{
  "error_code": "401",
  "message": "Unauthorized: Access token expired or invalid."
}

### Example 2: Resource Not Found

**Request:**
GET /api/users/12345

**Response:**
{
  "error_code": "404",
  "message": "Resource not found.",
  "details": {
    "resource_type": "user",
    "resource_id": "12345"
  }
}
