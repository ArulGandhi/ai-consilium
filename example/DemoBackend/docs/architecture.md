    try {
        await s3.upload({
            Bucket: bucketName,
            Key: key,
            Body: event.body
        }).promise();

        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'File uploaded successfully' })
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to upload file' })
        };
    }
};

### Example 2: User Authentication Function

The user authentication function is implemented using AWS Cognito. It automatically scales up or down based on demand, ensuring that resources are only allocated when needed.

const { CognitoIdentityServiceProvider } = require('aws-sdk');

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const cognitoIdp = new CognitoIdentityServiceProvider();
    const username = event.username;
    const password = event.password;

    try {
        await cognitoIdp.adminInitiateAuth({
            UserPoolId: 'us-east-1_abcdefg',
            AuthFlow: 'ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
            ClientId: 'your-client-id',
            AuthParameters: {
                USERNAME: username,
                PASSWORD: password
            }
        }).promise();

        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'User authenticated successfully' })
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return {
            statusCode: 401,
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to authenticate user' })
        };
    }
};

## Conclusion

The scalability of the DemoBackend project is achieved through a combination of serverless functions, AWS services, load balancing, auto scaling, and a CI/CD pipeline. This architecture ensures that the system can handle increasing loads efficiently without compromising performance or reliability.

By following best practices and leveraging AWS services, the DemoBackend project can achieve high scalability and maintain optimal performance.
